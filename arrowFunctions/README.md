** Arrow Functions **
Arrow functions are a preffered way to write anonymous functions in javaScript.

**Arrow Functions are prefferred due to:**
 - Simple syntax.
 - implicit *this* Binding: Arrow functions inherit the *this* value from their surrounding scope.
 - Lexical *this*: The *this* keyword inside an arrow function always refer to the same value, regardless of how the function is passed or called.
 - No need for return: Arro functions authomatically returns the value of the expression within their body if it is a single expression
