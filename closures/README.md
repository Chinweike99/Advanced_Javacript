**CLOSURES**
Closures in JavaScript are a powerful concept that allows functions to remember and access variables from their lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Closures are needed to maintain access to variables in an outer functions scope, even after th outer function has completed execution. they are particularly useful for creating private variables.

*Closures are commonly used in scenerios such as:*
 - Creating private variables and encapsulation.
 - Implementing callbacks and event handlers.
 - Managing asynchronous operation
 - Memoization and caching.
 - Curryinga and partial applications
